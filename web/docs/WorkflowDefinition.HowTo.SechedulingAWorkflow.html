<p>Workflow processes can be scheduled to trigger on a particular time, similar to a scheduled job. You could for example schedule it to run on daily basis, weekly basis or even on monthly basis. In your workflow, just drag the <a href="ScheduledTriggerActivity.html"><code>Scheduled Trigger Activity</code></a> and set your preference time for the scheduled job to run.</p>

<p>In this example our schedule is set to be running on the last day of the month. </p>
<p>Add action and select for Monthly.</p>
<p>Here, you can set the datetime for when your schedule to start running. Next, you just have to select on which month you would like the schedule to run and select <code>Last Day</code>. You can also set the date for when the schedule to expired if require.</p>
