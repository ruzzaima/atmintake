<h1 id="using-http-adapter">Using HTTP Adapter</h1>
<p>Http adapter allows you to create an adapter to connected to any web application where these 2 conditions</p>
<ul>
<li>When you don&#39;t have access to the backend database</li>
<li>When you want to preserve the existing application logic</li>
</ul>
<p>It works as a proxy to forward any request you made to the existing HTTP endpoint, acting as a browser</p>
<p>HttpAdapter uses <code>System.Net.HttpClient</code> internally to manage HTTP request to the remote server</p>
