<p>Attributes is defined by the schema designer, where you can design your object in a hierachical manner. <code>Rx Developer</code> call this <code>Member</code> <a href="Member.html">see more</a></p>
<p><code>Rx Developer</code> also allows you to creates a set of operations to your entity definition by means of <code>EntityOperation</code>, this is available from <code>EntityDefinition</code> designer.

<ol>
<li>The name of the <code>EntityOperation</code> , it must be a valid identifier for method name, as such cannot contain spaces, or special chars except <code>_</code>, and must start with a letter. For consistency we recommend using <code>PascalCase</code> e.g. &#39;<code>Demote</code></li>
<li>The <code>EntityDefinition</code> that you are working on</li>
<li>The name of the <code>EntityOperation</code>, refer #1</li>
<li>A set of <code>BusinessRule</code> you want to validate with, prior to executing your operation. If any of the rules failed to operation will not proceed and error messages will be show to the user.
Please refer to the <a href="businessrule.htm">BusinessRule</a> for more details about <code>BusinessRule</code></li>
<li>Set of roles/authorization required to execute the operation. The use must be in one of these roles in other for the execution to succeed, else status code <a href="http.403.htm">Status 403</a> will be returned.</li>
<li>You can specify <a href="childsetteraction.htm">setter actions</a> to set the values of your entity fields/attributes. For example setting the <code>Rating</code> field for <code>Customer</code> entity to be 1 less than the previous value using a <a href="functionfield.htm">FuctionField</a> <code>item.Rating -1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>EntityOperation</code> designer will not compile your code, clicking save will only save it to your <code>EntityDefinition</code> in which you will have to <code>Publish</code> it from the <code>EntityDefinition</code> designer.</p>
<p>Once compiled, a new Asp.Net MVC <code>Action</code> will be created with the name of the operation. Where it would take an instance of the <code>EntityDefinition</code> from the input stream, and run the specified business rules and if all passed the setter action will be called before submitting it to the persistence layer.
If you need to modify or do other works from this <code>EntityOperation</code> apart from simple field settings, you can use <a href="Trigger.html"><code>Trigger</code></a> where you
can call additional <a href="SetterAction.html"><code>SetterAction</code></a>, or <a href="EmailAction.html"><code>EmailAction</code></a> or <a href="StartWorkflowAction.html"><code>StartWorkflowAction</code></a>.</p>
<p>Operation can be decorated with permissions attribute, this consist set of <code>role</code> they user must have to perform the operation.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Anonymous</code> is for public unathenticated and authenticated users. Selecting this attribute will nullify the rest</li>
<li><code>Everybody</code> is only for authenticated users. Selecting this attribute will nullify the rest</li>
<li>Custom roles, you can select 1 or more of these roles but must not be together with either <code>Anonymous</code> or <code>Everybody</code></li>
</ul>
