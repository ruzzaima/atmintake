<h2 id="the-core-concepts">The core concepts</h2>
<p><code>Rx Developer</code> is a set of tools- designers, UI, widget that helps you to build your application and platform - a runtime for your application to run on, this including the architecture, the design and those runtime behavior.
As such it&#39;s important for you to understand the distinct between tools and platforms.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p><code>Rx Developer</code> consist a set of tools are built using <code>HTML5</code>, <code>CSS3</code> and <code>Javascript</code>, these choices are made in order to give you(the developers) the best experience while developing your app, without having to have huge installation for different tools. Our goals is to bring all the design and developers experience in a browser. Bringing your development environment where ever you might be.</p>
<p>These tools allows for most of the design and development process could be automated. Thus encapsulating developers from the low level infrastructure and let them focus on delivering business values for their users and clients.</p>
<p>The tools also allows developers to quickly build their app with little or no code at all. Less code or no code translate to less bugs, and higher productivity.</p>
<h2 id="platforms">Platforms</h2>
<p><code>Rx Developer</code> are build on top of Microsoft .Net framework runtime. It&#39;s the Microsoft implementation of CLR, not exactly a proprietary technology thus allowing you to have a mature platform in the enterprise area. <code>Rx Developer</code> is also develop with diferrent kind of approach and technology stack than prescribed by Microsoft. This is to enable for us to deliver a highly agile and scalable applications without locking in into specific vendors insfrastructure and implementations.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How to</h2>
<p>This section will provide you details on how to achieve certain things within a well know problem domains. This could be a simple problem such as <code>How to validate your custom object before submission</code> into running a complex workflow. Hopefully the <code>How to</code> section will give you a treasure chest for <code>Rx Developer</code> <code>Design Patterns</code> that will help you to deliver your high quality app faster.</p>
<h2 id="reference-implementation">Reference Implementation</h2>
<p>Step by step walktrough on how to create an app. We will present you from blank solution to a finish application in a beginner kind of approach</p>
